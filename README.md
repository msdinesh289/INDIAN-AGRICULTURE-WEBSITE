Agricultural Information Website
Project Overview
This project is a user-friendly web application designed to empower farmers with real-time, crucial agricultural data. Developed during my internship at Digipix, the website aims to simplify access to vital environmental metrics, enabling farmers to make informed decisions for better crop management and resource optimization.

Features
Real-time Data Display: Provides up-to-the-minute readings for key agricultural parameters.

Environmental Metrics: Displays data for:

Temperature

Humidity

Soil Moisture

pH values

Intuitive User Interface: Designed with a focus on ease of use, ensuring farmers can quickly access and understand the information.

Data Accessibility: Transforms raw sensor data into an easily digestible format, providing actionable insights.

Technologies Used
The website was developed using foundational web technologies:

HTML: For structuring the web content.

CSS: For styling and ensuring a clean, responsive layout.

JavaScript: For dynamic content, real-time data updates, and interactive elements.

Development Environment:

VS Code

Brackets

XAMPP (likely used for local server environment and possibly a basic database if implemented)

Installation & Setup (Conceptual)
While this project was part of an internship, typically a web project like this would involve:

Cloning the Repository:

git clone [Your-Repo-URL-Here]
cd agricultural-info-website

Local Server Setup: If using XAMPP, place the project files in the htdocs directory and start the Apache server.

Opening in Browser: Access the index.html file through your local server (e.g., http://localhost/agricultural-info-website/index.html).

(Note: Replace [Your-Repo-URL-Here] with the actual URL of your GitHub repository once created.)

How It Works
The website functions by fetching and presenting environmental data. While the specific data source (sensors, APIs) might vary, the front-end is built to clearly visualize these metrics, allowing farmers to monitor conditions relevant to their crops. The interface is designed for simplicity, ensuring that even users with limited technical experience can benefit from the information.

Contribution
This project was developed as part of a collaborative team effort during my internship. My contributions included:

Developing front-end components and user interface elements.

Implementing JavaScript logic for data display and interaction.

Collaborating on feature integration and user experience enhancements.
